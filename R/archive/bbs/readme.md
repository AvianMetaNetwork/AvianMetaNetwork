BBS Archive scripts for the AvianMetaNet

Author: Phoebe Zarnetske

These were used in 2024-2-25 but AviBase is used for this purpose instead. 

BBS linkage is useful so these are kept for reference

 - /R/archive/bbs/bbs_specieslist_L0.R = reads in current BBS species list and adds any species that was split
 - /R/archive/bbs/bbs_specieslist_L1.R = cleans the BBS species list, e.g., combining subspecies into species
